"Almost no company uses Kelly Blue Book. A lot of companies use NADA for a guideline, but the value is (more or less)
the market value of your vehicle as it was prior to the loss. What we usually say is, "It's closer to retail than
trade-in, but it isn't either." Unhelpful, right? There's a lot of ways to figure it out, but pretty much each company
has one system it follows when possible. Alternative methods include getting a quote from 3 dealerships on what they
believe it is worth, finding recently sold vehicles of very similar description, NADA or other similar services, etc."
